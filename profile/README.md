## Crafting a future for traditional tabletop RPG assets

Telurean aims to bring new possibilities to traditional tabletop role-playing games by turning their core elements—characters, items, stories, and worlds—into reusable and tradable crypto-assets. Using the Substrate framework, Telurean hopes to let these virtual assets live beyond their original tabletop sessions, adding to a growing, shared fantasy lore. The project is under development, with plans for open-source, freely available decentralized applications (first for Windows, later for Linux, and Mac) to create and manage these assets. A separate, commercial web-based marketplace is also planned to support trading, connecting tabletop RPG elements in a digital space.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Perdurability**: Ensure tabletop RPG assets persist beyond individual games, maintaining their value and significance.
- **Ownership**: Grant players true ownership of their digital assets as crypto-assets on the blockchain.
- **Traceability**: Provide a chronological record of each asset’s events, enhancing its narrative and historical value.

### Secondary Objectives
- **Economic System**: Create a balanced economic model that assigns real-world value to virtual assets, enabling a thriving marketplace for trading characters, items, maps, and more.

## Vision

Telurean bridges the gap between traditional traditional tabletop role-playing games and modern digital metaverses. In TTRPGs, players interact in fantastical worlds, pursue shared or competing goals, and earn rewards. Telurean uses blockchain technology to digitize and immortalize these elements—characters, items, game sessions, and maps—as crypto-assets. Unlike purely digital RPGs with direct access to digital resources, Telurean focuses on bringing the rich, narrative-driven assets of traditional tabletop RPGs into a shared, open virtual world.

Players will not only create and control their assets but also contribute to a living, breathing fantasy world that grows with every game session.
